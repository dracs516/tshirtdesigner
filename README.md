# TShirtDesigner

Started re-writing this project. Previous version is archived at the _[archived branch](https://github.com/luciferreeves/TShirtDesigner/tree/archived)_. This project is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE). 

I will roll out changes to the project gradually over time. Until then, you can keep using the old version.

## Demos

As newer changes the deployed, a rolling demo is available at: _[https://luciferreeves.github.io/TShirtDesigner](https://luciferreeves.github.io/TShirtDesigner)_.

Old demo can be found at: _[https://luciferreeves.github.io/TShirtDesigner/old](https://luciferreeves.github.io/TShirtDesigner/old)_.

_Initially a fork of [https://github.com/imomin/CustomTShirt](https://github.com/imomin/CustomTShirt)._
